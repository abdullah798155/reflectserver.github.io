        "description": "Alright Guys, Today I am talking about The Quran. I never thought that I would read the Quran in my Life. Especially as a Christian Orthodox. Islam has a problematic History on the Balkans......... Especially in Germany, where I grew up, I was surrounded by a a lot of Criminality propagated by foreigners which were Muslims. That made my view on the religion even more negative.In my 20s I dabbled in the New Age. I tried psychedelics like Magic Mushrooms, Ayahuasca, LSD etc. I even went to the Amazon Jungle to visit the Shamans. The Oneness of God was something that I encountered even there. Since I've been a Kid, The Oneness of God was undeniable. Once I reverted to Orthodoxy, I got confronted with the Trinity. This was the First Time I Questioned My Religion.",
